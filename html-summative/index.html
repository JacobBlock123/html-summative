        <h2>Choosing Your Parts:</h2>

        <h3><u>Central Processing Unit or CPU</u></h3>
        <p style="width: 60%;">
        The CPU is the brain of the computer and is a very important part of your PC. So it should be one
        of the most exepsnive parts of your build. Depending on what you will be using your computer for
        you should should spend more or less on it. If you plan on doing CPU intensive tasks you should
        get a more powerful CPU. Although you have to make sure it is compatible with the rest of your
        parts.
        </p>

        <h3><u>Motherboard</u></h3>
        <p style="width: 60%;">
        The Motherboard is also a very important part of your computer. It holds your CPU, your RAM and
        it also has your expansion slots. You have to make sure it has enough expansion slots, you have
        to check the NIC's connection type (wired or wireless), you have to make sure it supports the
        RAM speed and amount you want and finally it must have the same socket type as your CPU.
        </p>

        <h3><u>Random Access Memory or RAM</u></h3>
        <p style="width: 60%;">
            The RAM is used constantly and it is very important to have enough RAM for what you plan on
            using your computer for. Doing things like opening multiple tabs and using multiple programs
            at once can require plenty of RAM. Especially gaming. For basic usage anything from 4 to 8
            gigabytes should do. Although 8 gigabytes is probably on the lower end of gaming computers.
            If you plan on running heavy games you will want at least 16 gigabytes.
        </p>

        <h3><u>Storage</u></h3>
        <p style="width: 60%;">
            There are multiple types of storage devices. There are Hard Drives and Solid State Drives as
            well as a hybrid between the two. Hard Drives are cheaper and give you more storage, but
            they have worse performance than Solid State Drives. Solid State Drives have better performance,
            although they are considerably more expensive and have less storage per dollar. Many people
            buy one of each type of drive and store certain things they want to load faster, on their SSD.
            They also have an HDD so they have a large amount of storage if they need it.
        </p>

        <h3><u>Graphics Processing Unit</u></h3>
        <p style="width: 60%;">
            The Graphics Processor can be inside of your CPU or in the form of a dedicated graphics card.
            If you plan on gaming it is better to have a dedicated GPU. If you don't plan on doing to many
            graphic heavy tasks a CPU with a GPU inside will do fine.
        </p>

        <h3><u>Case and Fans</u></h3>
        <p style="width: 60%;">
            Computers run hot, so a good case, case fans and a CPU fan are important. First of all, your
            case must be big enough to fit your motherbaord. So if you have a large ATX form factor
            motherboard, you will have at least a mid size tower. In larger towers you will also be able
            to fit more fans. Secondly, case fans are important to keep high airflow. If you have a large
            powerful dedicated graphics card case fans can help keep it cool. Finally a good CPU fan is
            important. The CPU is one of the hottest things in your computer.
        </p>

        <h3><u>Power Supply</u></h3>
        <p style="width: 60%">
            The power supply provides power to every component in your computer. If you have a powerful
            CPU and dedicated GPU you will need a more powerful power supply. There are power supply
            wattage calculators online. Just enter your parts and it will tell you how many watts you will
            need. Make sure to check for modularity. Fully modular means you can remove and add cables
            as you please. Non-modular means all of the cables are permanently attached. Finally there is
            Semi-modular which means that some of the cables can be removed and attached.

            <tr>
                <td style="width: 30%;">Suggested for basic usage and little to no gaming. Can run basic
                program such as word and possibly gaming on low settings with less than 60 fps. For this
                tier a good CPU and GPU are not important. You will want a low end CPU with integrated
                graphics. If you plan on having many documents, photos and videos you will want a high
                storage HDD.</td>
                <td style="width: 30%">Suggested for esports titles and medium settings with high fps.
                Can run AAA games on medium-low setting with 60 to 100 fps. for this level of build
                you will most likely want a dedicated graphics card and a medium end CPU. You might
                want an HDD for high storage and if you have the budget add an SSD.</td>
                <td style="width: 30%">Can be used for high settings and high fps even on AAA titles.
                Can run on very high fps on even the toughest games on high settings. Most of the
                budget will be on a dedicated graphics card and a high end CPU. As well as 32 gigabytes
                of RAM and above. You may also want a good SSD for loading games and an HDD for extra
                storage because games take up lots of space.</td>

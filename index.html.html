    <h2 style="text-align: left;">Choosing Your Parts:</h2>

    <h3 style="text-align: left;">The Central Processing Unit or CPU</h3>
    <p style="width: 40%;">
        The CPU is the brain of the computer and is a very important part of your PC. So it should be one
        of the most exepsnive parts of your build. Depending on what you will be using your computer for
        you should should spend more or less on it. If you plan on doing CPU intensive tasks you should
        get a more powerful CPU. Although you have to make sure it is compatible with the rest of your
        parts.

    <h3 style="text-align: left;">The Motherboard</h3>
    <p style="width: 40%;">
        The Motherboard is also a very important part of your computer. It holds your CPU, your RAM and
        it also has your expansion slots. You have to make sure it has enough expansion slots, you have
        to check the NIC's connection type (wired or wireless), you have to make sure it supports the
        RAM speed and amount you want and finally it must have the same socket type as your CPU.
    </p>

    <h3 style="text-align: left;">The Random Access Memory or RAM</h3>
    <p style="width: 40%;">
        The RAM is used constantly and it is very important to have enough RAM for what you plan on
        using your computer for. Doing things like opening multiple tabs and using multiple programs
        at once can require plenty of RAM. Especially gaming. For basic usage anything from 4 to 8
        gigabytes should do. Although 8 gigabytes is probably on the lowest end of gaming computers.
